# Cooperation and political ideology: A longitudinal cross-lagged analysis

## Introduction

Over the past decades, it has become clear that psychological and behavioural dispositions vary across the political landscape [@Jost2003; @Jost2006; @Jost2017; @Graham2009; @Haidt2012; @Hibbing2013]. Psychological research has found that, compared to liberals, conservatives are more averse to threatening stimuli [@Hibbing2014], more sensitive to disgust [@Terrizzi2013], higher in need for closure [@Jost2003], and less open to experience [@Osborne2020]. More recently, research has shown that variation in behavioural preferences is also related to political ideology, policy views, and political party support. @Claessens2020b found that the "cooperative phenotype" (i.e., a general behavioural disposition measured by multiple economic games that captures a willingness to share resources at a cost to oneself) was negatively related to social dominance orientation (SDO; an ideological measure of support for hierarchy and dominance) and economically conservative policy views. The cooperative phenotype also predicted increased support for economically progressive political parties (Chapter 4). By contrast, conformist behaviour in the form of social information use was related to right-wing authoritarianism (RWA; an ideological measure of norm adherence and group conformity) and socially conservative policy views.

These studies have revealed cross-sectional correlations between psychological and behavioural dispositions and political attitudes, but it remains largely unclear how these variables causally influence one another. Do psychological and behavioural dispositions cause people to take particular political stances? Or does political ideology cause people to interpret psychological and behavioural measures differently? While cross-sectional data are unable to answer these questions, longitudinal data allow researchers to infer causality based on temporal precedence: the future cannot cause the past [@Hamaker2015].

Taking advantage of the variables for which we have multiple waves of data, in the current research we apply a longitudinal approach to specifically study the causal relationship between SDO and the cooperative phenotype. This longitudinal approach promises to extend upon not only the research by @Claessens2020b, but also the numerous previous studies finding a negative cross-sectional relationship between SDO and cooperation in economic games [@Halali2018; @Haesevoets2015; @Thielmann2020].

At least three longitudinal causal models are compatible with a cross-sectional correlation between SDO and the cooperative phenotype (Figure \@ref(fig:ch5theoreticalModels)). Under the _cooperation-as-outcome_ model, biological and environmental factors interact to produce political ideology [@Duckitt2009], and political ideology then influences how people behave in economic games. In short, ideology causes more general behavioural preferences. This causal model is often assumed _a priori_ to explain cross-sectional correlations between ideology and behaviour. For example, @Grunhage2020 write that "political orientation _predisposes for_ a more trusting or cooperative behavior" (italics added; p. 22).

(ref:ch5theoreticalModelsFigCaption) _At least three theoretical longitudinal causal models are compatible with the cross-sectional correlation between political ideology and the cooperative phenotype._ The cooperation-as-outcome model is inconsistent with the dual evolutionary foundations framework, while the cooperation-as-antecedent and common-cause models are consistent with the framework.

```{r ch5theoreticalModels, echo=F, fig.cap = "(ref:ch5theoreticalModelsFigCaption)", out.width = "\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ch5/theoreticalModels.png")
```

The cooperation-as-outcome model is inconsistent with the dual evolutionary framework of political ideology [@Claessens2020a], which explains ideology as underpinned by basic social drives that were favoured during human evolution. Human group living evolved via two key shifts [@Tomasello2012]; a shift towards increased cooperation with others, and a shift towards conformity to and enforcement of group-wide social norms. According to the dual evolutionary framework, variation in general drives for cooperation and group conformity arises from the interaction between heritable individual differences and socio-ecological environments. These general drives for cooperation and group conformity produce variation in the two dimensions of political ideology, rather than vice versa.

There is a stronger and weaker version of the causal argument underlying the dual evolutionary framework. Under the stronger version, which we will call the _cooperation-as-antecedent_ model, biological and environmental factors interact to produce the behavioural predispositions captured by economic games, and these behavioural predispositions influence the expression of political ideology. This model is captured by @VanLange2012, who write that "political preferences and voting are _partially rooted in_ interpersonal orientations" (italics added; p. 469). Under the weaker model, which we will call the _common-cause_ model, both behaviour and ideology are caused by the same biological and environmental factors, but do not directly influence one another over time. The common-cause model is inspired by recent longitudinal evidence showing that personality does not causally precede political ideology, as predicted by the dual process model of ideology [@Duckitt2009]  but instead personality and political ideology covary in parallel, likely due to common causes from biological and environmental factors [@Verhulst2012; @Osborne2020]. Similarly, the common-cause model predicts that SDO and the cooperative phenotype will be correlated, not because they influence one another over time, but because they share the same biological and environmental causes.

All three of these models predict a cross-sectional correlation between political ideology and cooperative behaviour, and so previous cross-sectional work [@Haesevoets2015; @Haesevoets2018; @Halali2018; @Claessens2020b] cannot distinguish between them. Previous longitudinal work has shown that cooperative dispositions predict voting outcomes four weeks and eight months later [@VanLange2012] but, without a concurrent measure of political ideology, this result cannot distinguish between the different models. Thus, in order to test between all three models, longitudinal research must measure cooperative behaviour, political ideology, policy views, and party support together over time within the same individuals.

Here, we use a pre-registered cross-lagged longitudinal design with two time-points separated by eighteen months to test the directions of causality between the cooperative phenotype, social dominance orientation, views on economic issues, and political party support. Cross-lagged panel models are commonly used in political psychology to study the antecedents and outcomes of political ideology. Previous research using cross-lagged panel models has largely focused on self-reported variables, showing that SDO is temporally preceded by a competitive worldview [@Sibley2007; @Sibley2013] and predicts future prejudice [@Asbrock2010], nationalism [@Osborne2017], economic policy views [@Sibley2010a], and political party support [@Satherley2020]. But this previous work has not examined how behavioural preferences covary with political ideology over time. Filling this gap, we test whether the cooperative phenotype is an antecedent, outcome, or cross-sectional covariate of social dominance orientation, views on economic issues, and party support over time.

## Methods

### Participants and sampling

```{r echo=F}
loadd(ch5_d)
```

Participants were sampled from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), an annual longitudinal self-report study that has been active since 2009. This participant pool is initially contacted by the NZAVS through random draws from the New Zealand electoral roll, making this a representative sample of the New Zealand population. NZAVS participants from an initial sample frame (_n_ = 3345; see Appendix to Chapter 3, Supplementary Methods for sample frame criteria) were contacted in 2019 with an invitation to participate in an additional economic game study. 1045 participated in the first wave of economic game data collection in 2019, were successfully paid for the study, and did not time out of their session. In the second wave in 2020, this sample size dropped to 631 (60% retention rate). We only analysed data from participants that completed both waves of economic game data collection (_N_ = `r nrow(ch5_d)`; `r printnum(sum(ch5_d$Gender.T10 == 0, na.rm = T))` females; mean age = `r printnum(mean(ch5_d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` years; age range = `r printnum(min(ch5_d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` - `r printnum(max(ch5_d$Age.T10, na.rm = T), digits = 0)` years).

### Materials

#### New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study measures

Main self-report measures were taken from Waves 10 and 11 of the NZAVS. The primary measures of interest for this study were social dominance orientation, support for income redistribution, income attribution (i.e., the belief that people would be less likely to work hard if incomes were equal), and support for the New Zealand National Party. We chose these measures because they all exhibited cross-sectional correlations with the cooperative phenotype in previous research [@Claessens2020b]. Other time-invariant covariates were taken from Wave 10 of the NZAVS: age, gender, ethnicity, education, local deprivation, socio-economic status, religiosity, and RWA. See Appendix to Chapter 5, Table \@ref(tab:ch5itemTable) for full list of self-report items.

#### Battery of economic games

Across two waves of data collection, participants completed three incentivised one-shot economic games, conducted online in real-time using oTree software [@Chen2016]. As described in Chapter 3, these games measure cooperative behaviour, and are largely identical to the cooperation games used in @Peysakhovich2014. Where necessary, we used the strategy method to elicit responses in all possible roles. Participants played for points, which were converted to New Zealand dollars (1 point = $0.035).

The three cooperation games are as follows:

- _Dictator Game_. Player A is given 100 points. They must decide how many of these points to transfer to Player B. Player A keeps the remaining points. Player B is passive in the interaction.
- _Trust Game_. Players A and B both start with 50 points. First, Player A decides whether or not to transfer all 50 points to Player B, in the knowledge that the transferred amount will be tripled to 150 points. If Player A transfers, Player B now has 200 points. Player B must then decide to transfer between 0 and 150 points back to Player A.
- _Public Goods Game_. Four players begin with 100 points each. They can contribute between 0 and 100 points into a shared group project. All four decisions are made simultaneously, and then the amount in the group project is doubled and distributed evenly between all four players. Each player ends the game with their share from the group project, plus the points they initially refrained from contributing.

### Procedure

The NZAVS collects self-report data both online and via paper surveys posted to participants. In Wave 10 of the study, most of the data were collected between November 2018 and September 2019, and in Wave 11 of the study, most of the data were collected between October 2019 and November 2020 (see Appendix to Chapter 5, Figure \@ref(fig:ch5timelinePlot) for timeline).

Data collection for the first wave of economic games was conducted between 18^th^ February and 25^th^ July 2019, and data collection for the second wave was conducted between 19^th^ October and 11^th^ November 2020. In both waves, participants were booked into sessions on midweek evenings and completed the session online in real-time. Session sizes varied between 14 and 130 participants. Although participants knew they were completing the study with other NZAVS participants, they did not know specifically who they were interacting with in the sessions.

At the beginning of the session, participants completed a consent form and read some information about the study. Participants then proceeded to the eight behavioural tasks. In the first wave, all eight tasks (three cooperation games plus additional tasks) were completed in a randomised order. In the second wave, the economic games shared with the first wave were completed first in a randomised order, followed by the two new tasks which were presented in a separately randomised order. For each task, participants read the instructions for the task, completed a comprehension question, and then proceeded to make their decisions.

Once participants completed all eight tasks, they entered a waiting lobby in which they waited for all other participants in their session to complete the tasks. Participants had a maximum of 55 minutes to complete all the tasks. If they took longer than this time, they were skipped ahead to the waiting lobby. Timeouts were still paid their show-up fee, but not their bonus. In the first wave, participants took `r printnum(mean(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` minutes on average to complete all eight tasks (SD = `r printnum(sd(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` mins, range = `r printnum(min(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` - `r printnum(max(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T10 / 60), digits = 0)` mins), and in the second wave, participants took `r printnum(mean(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` minutes on average (SD = `r printnum(sd(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` mins, range = `r printnum(min(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` - `r printnum(max(ch5_d$egame.SecsAll.T11 / 60), digits = 0)` mins).

After all participants completed the games, the computer randomly matched participants into groups to determine their bonus payment from the session. Participants were paid a \$20 New Zealand dollar show-up fee, plus their bonus payment. In the first wave, participants earned a bonus payment of \$`r printnum(mean(ch5_d$egame.Paid.T10 - 20))` on average (SD = \$`r printnum(sd(ch5_d$egame.Paid.T10 - 20))`). In the second wave, participants earned a bonus payment of \$`r printnum(mean(ch5_d$egame.Paid.T11 - 20))` on average (SD = \$`r printnum(sd(ch5_d$egame.Paid.T11 - 20))`).

### Pre-registration

We pre-registered our hypotheses on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ksw3x/) on 28^th^ September 2020, before running the second wave of economic game data collection. First, we hypothesised that the cooperation games in the second wave would all load onto a single latent variable, replicating our previous work [@Claessens2020b]. Second, we hypothesised that this "cooperative phenotype" would be negatively predicted by SDO, again replicating our previous work [@Claessens2020b]. Third, we hypothesised that the "cooperative phenotype" latent variable would have at least scalar measurement invariance across waves, providing further evidence for its stability over time [@Carlsson2014; @Peysakhovich2014]. Fourth, we predicted that our longitudinal cross-lagged panel models would provide support for at least one of the causal models visualised in Figure \@ref(fig:ch5theoreticalModels).

### Statistical analysis

We used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test our pre-registered hypotheses. For measurement invariance analyses, we fitted a confirmatory factor analysis model with correlated item errors across waves to deal with non-independence of observations. For our longitudinal modelling, we used two-wave two-variable cross-lagged panel models. To deal with missing data across waves when analysing self-report items, we used multiple imputation with predictive mean matching [@R-mice], pooling our estimates across 20 imputed datasets. Visual inspection confirmed the plausibility of imputed values (see Appendix to Chapter 5, Figure \@ref(fig:ch5impPlot)). All analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.2 [@R-base] using the _lavaan_ package [@R-lavaan]. Figures were created using _ggraph_ [@R-ggraph], _cowplot_ [@R-cowplot], and _ggplot2_ [@R-ggplot2] packages, multiple imputation was implemented using the _mice_ package [@R-mice], and reproducibility of all analyses was ensured by using the _drake_ package [@R-drake].

### Ethical approval

Ethical approval for the first wave of data collection was provided by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee on 19^th^ July 2018 for three years (ref: 021666), with an ethics amendment granted for the second wave of data collection.

## Results

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F, results="hide"}
loadd(ch5_cfa1)
loadd(ch5_sem1)
s <- data.frame(summary(ch5_sem1, ci = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE))
```

In the first step of our pre-registered analyses, we focused solely on the second wave of data in order to replicate our previous findings from the first wave [@Claessens2020b]. First, we fitted a confirmatory factor analysis model with the Trust Game (Give), Trust Game (Return), Dictator Game, and Public Goods Game loading onto a "cooperative phenotype" latent variable. Supporting our first pre-registered hypothesis, all factor loadings were significantly positive (_p_ < 0.05) and the model fitted the data well according to established fit statistic cutoffs [CFI = `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(ch5_cfa1)['cfi']))`, RMSEA = `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(ch5_cfa1)['rmsea']))`, SRMR = `r printnum(as.numeric(fitMeasures(ch5_cfa1)['srmr']))`; Appendix to Chapter 5, Figure \@ref(fig:ch5cfa1Plot); @Hu1999; @MacCallum1996]. Second, we fitted a structural equation model with SDO as the sole predictor of the cooperative phenotype latent variable. Supporting our second pre-registered hypothesis, we found that SDO significantly negatively predicted the cooperative phenotype with a small-to-medium effect size (standardised $\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_sem1)[5,4])`, unstandardised _b_ = `r printnum(s[5,5])`, 95% confidence interval [`r printnum(s[5,10])` `r printnum(s[5,11])`], _p_ `r printp(s[5,9])`, _r_ = `r printnum(sqrt(s[24,5]))`; Appendix to Chapter 5, Figure \@ref(fig:ch5sem1Plot)). These findings replicate our previous work with the same sample of participants eighteen months later [@Claessens2020b].

loadd(ch5_configMI)
loadd(ch5_metricMI)
loadd(ch5_scalarMI)
loadd(ch5_strictMI)
```

In the next step of our pre-registered analyses, we tested the measurement invariance of the cooperative phenotype latent variable across the two waves. Longitudinal measurement invariance testing ensures that latent factor structures are stable over time, an important prerequisite to cross-lagged panel modelling. We tested for measurement invariance of the cooperative phenotype factor structure in a series of increasingly restrictive nested models [Table \@ref(tab:ch5tableCompareMI); @vanDeSchoot2012]. For all model comparisons, we pre-registered the use of changes in fit statistics as thresholds for diagnosing reduced model fit [$\Delta$CFI < -0.01, $\Delta$RMSEA > 0.015; @Chen2007] rather than $\chi^2$ differences which are sensitive to large sample sizes. To deal with non-independence of observations, all measurement invariance models had correlated item errors across waves.

First, we fitted a configural invariance model, which freely estimated the cooperative phenotype latent variable in the first wave and the second wave simultaneously. As expected, this configural invariance model fitted the data well (CFI = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_configMI)['cfi'])`, RMSEA = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_configMI)['rmsea'])`) and all loadings were significantly positive. Second, we fitted a metric invariance model, which constrained the item loadings to equality across the two waves. Model fit did not substantially change ($\Delta$CFI = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_metricMI)['cfi'] - fitMeasures(ch5_configMI)['cfi'], digits = 3)`, $\Delta$RMSEA = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_metricMI)['rmsea'] - fitMeasures(ch5_configMI)['rmsea'], digits = 3)`). Third, we fitted a scalar invariance model, which constrained the item loadings, intercepts, and thresholds to equality across the two waves. Again, model fit did not substantially change ($\Delta$CFI = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_scalarMI)['cfi'] - fitMeasures(ch5_metricMI)['cfi'], digits = 3)`, $\Delta$RMSEA = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_scalarMI)['rmsea'] - fitMeasures(ch5_metricMI)['rmsea'], digits = 3)`). Fourth, and finally, we fitted a strict invariance model, which constrained the item loadings, intercepts, thresholds, and variances to equality across waves. Model fit remained unchanged ($\Delta$CFI = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_strictMI)['cfi'] - fitMeasures(ch5_scalarMI)['cfi'], digits = 3)`, $\Delta$RMSEA = `r printnum(fitMeasures(ch5_strictMI)['rmsea'] - fitMeasures(ch5_scalarMI)['rmsea'], digits = 3)`). Thus, measurement invariance analysis supports strict invariance of the cooperative phenotype latent variable over time, suggesting that the cooperative phenotype exhibits sufficient test-retest reliability and is stable over eighteen months within the same individuals.

(ref:ch5tableCompareMICaption) _Measurement invariance analysis of the cooperative phenotype latent variable supports strict measurement invariance across two waves separated by eighteen months._ CFI = Comparative Fit Index; RMSEA = Root Mean Square Error of Approximation; SRMR = Standardised Root Mean Square Residual.

```{r ch5tableCompareMI, echo=F, message=F, warning=F, results='asis'}

  booktabs = TRUE, caption = "(ref:ch5tableCompareMICaption)"
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)
```

Having established measurement invariance for the cooperative phenotype latent variable across waves, we then proceeded to fit our pre-registered two-variable two-wave cross-lagged panel models. For these models, we continued to constrain item loadings, intercepts, thresholds, and variances for the cooperative phenotype factor across waves, and also continued to correlate item errors across waves. Additionally, we included auto-regressive paths, cross-lagged paths, and within-wave covariances to form the structural component of the cross-lagged panel model.

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
loadd(ch5_clpm1.01)
s <- as.data.frame(summary(ch5_clpm1.01, ci = TRUE))
```

We first fitted our primary cross-lagged panel model, modelling the relationship between SDO and the cooperative phenotype over time (Figure \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotSDO)a). We found significantly positive auto-regressive effects: SDO in the first wave predicted SDO in the second wave ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1.01)[34,4])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s[34,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[34,10])` `r printnum(s[34,11])`], _p_ `r printp(s[34,9])`) and the cooperative phenotype in the first wave predicted the cooperative phenotype in the second wave ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1.01)[31,4])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s[31,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[31,10])` `r printnum(s[31,11])`], _p_ `r printp(s[31,9])`). Additionally, we found that the cooperative phenotype in the first wave negatively predicted SDO in the second wave ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1.01)[33,4])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s[33,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[33,10])` `r printnum(s[33,11])`], _p_ = `r printp(s[33,9])`), but SDO did not predict later cooperation ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1.01)[32,4])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s[32,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[32,10])` `r printnum(s[32,11])`], _p_ = `r printp(s[32,9])`). These cross-lagged paths were significantly different from one another (difference in unstandardised estimates = `r printnum(s[47,5])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s[47,10])` `r printnum(s[47,11])`], _p_ = `r printp(s[47,9])`). 

```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
loadd(ch5_clpm1_gender)
loadd(ch5_clpm1_ethnic)
s1 <- as.data.frame(summary(readd(ch5_clpm1_gender), ci = TRUE))
s2 <- as.data.frame(summary(readd(ch5_clpm1_ethnic), ci = TRUE))
```

To assess the robustness of the cross-lagged effect from the cooperative phenotype to later political ideology, we ran additional cross-lagged panel models statistically controlling for a wide range of time-invariant covariates: age, gender, ethnicity, education level, socio-economic status, local deprivation, religiosity, and RWA (Figures \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotSDO)b and \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotSDO)c). The cross-lagged path from the cooperative phenotype to later SDO remained significantly negative when controlling for most socio-demographics, but was attenuated when controlling for gender and ethnicity. Given these results, we ran exploratory multi-group cross-lagged panel models with separate groups for (1) male and female participants, and (2) New Zealand European and non-New Zealand European participants (due to small sample sizes in individual Asian, M&#257;ori, and Pacific groups). These follow-up models revealed that the cross-lagged path from the cooperative phenotype to later SDO was significantly negative for males ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1_gender)[79,5])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s1[79,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s1[79,12])` `r printnum(s1[79,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s1[79,11])`) but not for females ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1_gender)[33,5])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s1[33,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s1[33,12])` `r printnum(s1[33,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s1[33,11])`), though these effect sizes were similar and in the same direction. Similarly, the cross-lagged path from the cooperative phenotype to later SDO was significantly negative for New Zealand European participants ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1_ethnic)[79,5])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s2[79,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s2[79,12])` `r printnum(s2[79,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s2[79,11])`) but not for non-New Zealand European participants ($\beta$ = `r printnum(standardizedSolution(ch5_clpm1_ethnic)[33,5])`, _b_ = `r printnum(s2[33,7])`, 95% CI [`r printnum(s2[33,12])` `r printnum(s2[33,13])`], _p_ = `r printp(s2[33,11])`), though these effect sizes were similar and in the same direction.

```

To assess the generalisability of the cross-lagged effect from the cooperative phenotype to later political ideology, we swapped out SDO in our cross-lagged panel model for additional measures of views on economic issues and political party support. As these additional measures were single Likert scale items, we treated them as ordered variables in our modelling. When we included support for income redistribution in the model instead of SDO, we found the same pattern of results: the cooperative phenotype positively predicted future support for income redistribution, but support for income redistribution did not predict future cooperation (Appendix to Chapter 5, Figure \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotIncRed)a). This pattern of results held when controlling for all socio-demographic controls except gender, ethnicity, and religiosity (Appendix to Chapter 5, Figures \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotIncRed)b and \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotIncRed)c). However, when we included income attribution views and support for New Zealand's centre-right National Party in the model instead of SDO, we found no cross-lagged effects over time (Appendix to Chapter 5, Figures \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotIncAtt) and \@ref(fig:ch5clpmPlotPolNat)). Nevertheless, the within-wave correlations in these models were in the expected direction, with the cooperative phenotype negatively covarying cross-sectionally with both income attribution views and support for the National Party.

## Discussion

In a cross-lagged longitudinal analysis of cooperative behaviour and self-reported political attitudes, we have shown that the cooperative phenotype predicts SDO a year and a half later, but SDO does not predict future variation in the cooperative phenotype. This result is in line with the cooperation-as-antecedent model (Figure \@ref(fig:ch5theoreticalModels)) which posits that general behavioural predispositions like the cooperative phenotype causally influence political ideology, but not vice versa. This causal model explains previously reported negative cross-sectional correlations between cooperation and SDO [@Haesevoets2015; @Haesevoets2018; @Halali2018; @Thielmann2020; @Claessens2020b] as the result of a causal path from behavioural preferences to political ideology.

Additionally, the cross-lagged path from cooperation to future SDO was robust to a wide range of time-invariant socio-demographic covariates, including variables known to covary with SDO [e.g., education, socio-economic status, RWA; @Sidanius1996; @Pratto1994; @Sidanius2000]. However, this cross-lagged path was attenuated when controlling for gender and ethnicity. In particular, exploratory analyses revealed that the cross-lagged effect held only for male New Zealand European participants. This is similar to the finding that upper body strength is related to support for inequality in males, but not females [@Petersen2019]. Echoing the argument in @Petersen2019, a possible evolutionary explanation for this effect of gender might be that humans have large sexual dimorphism in strength and formidability, and so reductions in the cooperative phenotype are more likely to result in dominative and competitive tactics for resource distribution specifically among males. But this does not explain the effect of ethnicity. Perhaps a simpler explanation is that SDO is higher among males and people from dominant ethnic groups [@Pratto1994; @Sidanius1994; @Sidanius2000]. Among these participants, there is potentially more room for a reduction in SDO over time, whereas female participants from minority ethnic groups may exhibit much less variation in the scale. Future research should disentangle the roles of gender and ethnicity in the causal relationship between behavioural predispositions and political ideology.

When we generalised our cross-lagged analysis to other measures of economic ideology, we found more mixed results. As expected, the cooperative phenotype positively predicted future support for income redistribution, but cooperation was not longitudinally related to support for the centre-right National Party, nor was it longitudinally related to income attribution beliefs. One potential explanation for these null findings is that party affiliation and income attribution beliefs are generally less amenable to change over time: people rarely shift their political party affiliation [@PewResearchCenter2020] and income attribution beliefs have themselves been characterised as a stable individual difference [@Osborne2015; but see @Piff2020 for evidence that active interventions can shift income attribution beliefs over a five-month period]. Nevertheless, support for the National Party and income attribution beliefs were negatively related to the cooperative phenotype _within_ waves, which supports the common-cause model (Figure \@ref(fig:ch5theoreticalModels)). This model posits that the cooperative phenotype and political ideology covary due to shared causes from common biological and environmental influences.

Taken together, then, our results are broadly consistent with the dual evolutionary foundations framework for political ideology. All our analyses supported either the cooperation-as-antecedent or common-cause models, and none of the analyses supported the cooperation-as-outcome model, a model which is inconsistent with the dual evolutionary foundations framework (Figure \@ref(fig:ch5theoreticalModels)). Moreover, our measurement invariance analysis revealed that the cooperative phenotype latent variable had adequate test-retest reliability over eighteen months, supporting another central claim from the dual evolutionary foundations framework that the general social drives underlying political ideology should be relatively stable over time. This finding expands on previous correlational evidence showing that cooperative behaviour in individual economic games positively covaries when measured over four months [@Peysakhovich2014; @Reigstad2017], one year [@Lonnqvist2015], and even six years [@Carlsson2014].

One important limitation of this study is our use of standard two-wave cross-lagged panel models to determine longitudinal effects. Cross-lagged panel models have been criticised for not correctly partitioning within-person change from stable between-person differences [@Hamaker2015]. As an alternative to the cross-lagged panel model, @Hamaker2015 proposed the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model, which estimates a random intercept to capture stable individual differences over time that are not adequately captured by auto-regressive parameters. This alternative model can substantially change the parameter estimates of standard cross-lagged panel models [e.g., @Osborne2020]. Unfortunately, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models require at least three waves of data to be identified [@Hamaker2015], and so we were limited by our two waves of data in this study. Moving forward, it would be valuable to extend this study to include a third wave (and, if possible, additional waves) of behavioural and self-report data collection to determine if our results hold when accounting for stable between-person differences.

Future research should expand our multi-wave behavioural and self-report approach to include additional measures. Although the effect sizes for cross-sectional correlations between behavioural and self-report variables tend to be small [@Dang2020], measuring these variables across multiple waves can expand our understanding of the causal relationships between people's behavioural predispositions and their personalities, attitudes, values, and beliefs. In particular, to provide a complete picture for the dual evolutionary foundations framework, future research should test whether group conformist behavioural predispositions causally precede RWA and social policy views. This was not possible in the current study, because we did not have longitudinal data for the conformity measure that has been shown to correlate cross-sectionally with RWA [social information use; @Claessens2020b]. Extending this research longitudinally will allow researchers to make causal, rather than just correlational, claims in support of the dual evolutionary framework of political ideology.
